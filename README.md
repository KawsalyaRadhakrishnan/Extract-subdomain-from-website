# Extract-subdomain-from-website

Subdomain is an additional part of a main domain which are created to organise and navigate different sections of websites. It considered as hierarchy without going through all of the trouble of setting up a new site with a new domain or confusing vivitors with completetly root domain. 

The python code shown in my github is used to extract subdomain from the webpage. I have written this python code for the purpose of Mosse cybersecurity Institute Remote internship exercise.
